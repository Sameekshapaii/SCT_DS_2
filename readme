# Task 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship**.  
The objective of Task 2 is to perform **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a real-world dataset to understand relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** abalone.csv  
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains information about abalones (marine shellfish), including physical measurements and age indicators. The target variable **Rings** is used to estimate the age of each abalone.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 📊 Task Objectives
- Load and inspect the dataset  
- Perform data cleaning (handling missing values and renaming columns)  
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualize relationships between variables  
- Identify patterns and trends affecting abalone age  

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Performed
- Examined dataset structure and summary statistics  
- Handled missing values and verified data types  
- Analyzed the distribution of abalones by sex  
- Studied relationships between age (**Rings**) and:
  - Sex  
  - Physical measurements (Length, Diameter, Height)  
  - Weight features (Whole weight, Shucked weight, Viscera weight, Shell weight)  
- Visualized data using count plots, histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Most abalones have between **8 and 12 rings**  
- Physical size and weight features generally increase with age  
- Strong correlations exist between weight-related measurements  
- Sex has a minor influence on age compared to size-related features
